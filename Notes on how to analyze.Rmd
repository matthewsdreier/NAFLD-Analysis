Weight binning

Correlate cage temperature with cage weight

Correlation between temp and weight per mouse


When do mice cross a certain threshold of weight gain? Eg after 30 days on HFD for Lab and after 70 d for wildling? (DONE)

Weight Gain per week? How much weight in % do mice gain within one week? Does the weight gain in the end of the experiment correlate with the drop in temperature?

Weight gain of mice before and after LPS challenge. Maybe try do find difference in linear regression before and after LPS? At what point does the weekly percentage of weight gain change?
